I need to remove broken FeatureOrbit code from lines approximately 1211-1692 in SwedishInvestmentImmersive.tsx

The import has been added: import FeatureOrbitClean from './FeatureOrbit_Clean'
The usage has been changed to: <FeatureOrbitClean className="w-full" size={420} csvData={rows} />

Now I need to remove the old broken FeatureOrbit implementation that's causing syntax errors.

The FeatureOrbit_Clean.tsx component is working correctly and contains:
- Smart positioning without overlaps
- Category-based orbital positioning (RTF, Momentum, Standard)
- Size-based visualization using percentage change
- Interactive hover effects
- Color-coded categories (Blue, Green, Orange)
